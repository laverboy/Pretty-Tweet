Pretty Tweet
============

Pretty Tweet is a really simple jQuery plugin that gets the latest tweet from
the provided username along with a pretty timestamp and highlighted links, users and hashes.

Usage
-----

Make sure both jQuery and Pretty Tweet are both included on the page then simply 
add an element with an attribute of data-prettyweet=[twitter username].

    <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="/js/prettytweet.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    
    <div data-prettytweet="mlaver"></div>
    
That is all.
